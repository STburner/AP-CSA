1. Ensure you have a Java development environment set up (e.g., JDK and an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse).
2. Download and extract the Word Processor project files.
3. Open the project in your IDE.
4. Implement the find, remove, and replace methods in the WordProcessor class.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the `find` method to check if a substring exists in a given string.
2. Use the `remove` method to remove the first occurrence of a substring from a string.
3. Use the `replace` method to replace the first occurrence of a substring with another string.
4. Test each method individually using the provided test class to ensure correctness.
